Also, [DIY is a community](https://diy.org/) where tens of thousands of kids get to share what they do and learn skills.\r\n\r\n### What we do\r\nPDX DIY club is a group that works together to practice skills (like [Bike Mechanic](https://diy.org/skills/bikemechanic)), do creative projects (like [make a game from scratch](https://diy.org/skills/salvager/challenges/64/make-a-game-from-scrap)) and take epic adventures together (like exploring the [Japanese Gardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_garden) while checking off [botanist skills](https://diy.org/skills/botanist)). We get together periodially and are just a bunch of friends hacking on random projects.\r\n\r\n### How to join\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
